                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>The Japanese Language Association at the University of Minnesota (JLA) is a student-run organization 
                        that seeks to support students on campus in learning Japanese. Our organization offers several in-person events throughout the academic year as well as an online community. 
                        Members do not need to be enrolled in a Japanese language class at the UMN to apply.</p>

                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is separated into four parts â€“ to create an inclusive, welcoming environment for students; 
                        to provide a support group for those who are currently learning Japanese, and/or are planning to study abroad in Japan; 
                        to promote discussion on major concepts and issues in Japanese society with the purpose of informing members;
                         and to provide social activities and events for members of the organization.</p>
